fix: Force service worker cache clear and prevent vendor JS caching

## Problem
Build succeeded with Node 20 but site still shows blank page with
"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createContext')" error.

Root cause: Service worker serving OLD cached vendor JavaScript files
from the broken Node 18 build, even after new build was deployed.

## Solution
1. Service Worker Updates (public/sw.js)
   - Bump cache version from v2 to v3-2025-12-02 (forces cache clear)
   - Add rule to NEVER cache vendor-*.js files (always fetch fresh)
   - Prevents serving stale/incompatible vendor bundles

2. Aggressive Update Strategy (src/App.tsx)
   - Force service worker update on every app load
   - Unregister old service workers before registering new ones
   - Check for updates every 60 seconds
   - Listen for new service worker installation
   - Improves update delivery to users

3. User Documentation
   - Add CACHE_CLEAR_INSTRUCTIONS.md (step-by-step for users)
   - Add QUICK_FIX.md (fast reference)
   - Add FINAL_FIX_SUMMARY.md (complete technical overview)

## Impact
- Users will need to clear browser cache ONCE to see the fix
- After that, service worker will auto-update for future deployments
- Vendor JS files always fetch fresh (small perf trade-off for reliability)
- Prevents this type of cache issue from happening again

## User Action Required
Users must clear their browser cache one time:
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Or follow detailed instructions in CACHE_CLEAR_INSTRUCTIONS.md

## Files Changed
- public/sw.js (cache version bump, no vendor caching)
- src/App.tsx (aggressive SW update strategy)
- CACHE_CLEAR_INSTRUCTIONS.md (new)
- QUICK_FIX.md (new)
- FINAL_FIX_SUMMARY.md (new)
- COMMIT_MESSAGE_V2.txt (new)

## Testing
- Clear browser cache completely
- Verify site loads in normal browser
- Verify site loads in incognito
- Check console for "App mounted successfully"
- No errors about createContext
- Service worker version shows v3

## Rollback
If issues occur: git revert HEAD && git push origin main
Low risk - only clears caches and improves update delivery
