Fix: Resolve Node version incompatibility causing blank site on Cloudflare Pages

## Problem
Site was loading only background with console error:
"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createContext')"

Build logs showed Node 18.20.8 with EBADENGINE warnings for packages
requiring Node 20+.

## Solution
1. Node Version Configuration
   - Add .nvmrc and .node-version files specifying Node 20.11.0
   - Update package.json with engines field requiring Node >=20.0.0
   - Update wrangler.toml with NODE_VERSION build environment variable

2. Build Optimization
   - Update vite.config.ts chunk splitting to avoid dependency issues
   - Change build target from es2015 to es2020 for better compatibility
   - Add scheduler to React vendor chunk for proper initialization

3. Service Worker Fix
   - Change JavaScript caching strategy from cache-first to network-first
   - Prevents serving stale/corrupted code from cache

4. Error Handling
   - Add React loading verification in main.tsx
   - Add user-friendly error messages and recovery UI
   - Prevent silent failures

5. Documentation
   - Add BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md with troubleshooting guide
   - Add DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md with deployment steps

## Files Changed
- package.json (added engines field)
- vite.config.ts (improved chunking, updated target)
- wrangler.toml (added NODE_VERSION)
- src/main.tsx (added error handling)
- public/sw.js (updated caching strategy)
- .nvmrc (new)
- .node-version (new)
- BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md (new)
- DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md (new)

## Testing
After deployment:
- Build should use Node 20.x.x (not 18.x.x)
- No EBADENGINE warnings in build logs
- Site should load completely (not just background)
- Console should show "App mounted successfully"

## Next Steps
See DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md for detailed deployment instructions
